# Python minis

## About
A collection of python mini or small-scale software development projects that involve creating simple applications, tools, or games using the Python programming language. These projects are typically designed to be completed in a short amount of time, and may serve as a practical and fun way for beginners (like myself) to learn Python programming concepts and syntax.
